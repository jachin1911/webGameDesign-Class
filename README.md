Sample code for intro to programming class in JavaScript

This is the sample code for our intro to programming class.
Each week is in it's own sandbox directory.

## Naming
Each week's lessons are numbered by the original author in two different ways. Both globally from the begining to the end of the course; i.e. 1-44, and weekly starting from 1.

I have chosen to preserver both names since they are referenced in two different ways. This should actually reduce confusion since the lesson numbers start over each week at 1, and we need to be able to reference all of the lessons over the who course.

Therefore, when you see a file name like; Solution-L1(3)-dynamic_js.html, the name means that this is the solution to the dynamic javascript exercise in weekly lesson 1, which is alos course lesson 3. 

So, week 10 will have a lesson 1 exercise which is course lesson 33. The number in parentheses will not repeat, the the number next to the L will repeat every week.

## Directories
Each directory contains the sample code used in on the lesson pdf, and the solutions printed in the pdf. This is both to save you time typing in the examples, and so that you can check your work after you do the exercises.

If you are having trouble getting your solution to the exercise to work, you can take a look at the solution and see what you missed. You can also run the solution to see what the expected output looks like.
